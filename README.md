DISEASE BURDEN, 2000â€“2016
The latest global, regional and country-level estimates of cause-specific disability-adjusted life year (DALYs), 
years of life lost (YLL) and years lost due to disability (YLD) for the year 2000, 2010, 2015 and 2016 are available for download below.

JJ comment: this dataset has all causes of death for all countries, by region, including various types of cancer, heart disease, etc. 
The data shows DALYs.
I was not able to sort the data, though, due to some excel issues
